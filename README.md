# 🧠 ChoiceCraft – Dual-Persona Conversational AI

**ChoiceCraft** is an OpenAI-powered AI assistant that responds to your input with two distinct personas:

- 🧘‍♂️ **Therapist** – Calm, empathetic, and emotionally intelligent
- 🔥 **Choaser** – Bold, unfiltered, and radically honest

Whether you're seeking emotional support or a raw dose of truth, ChoiceCraft empowers you to explore both paths — and craft your own insight from the contrast.

## ✨ Features

- 🧠 **Two agents, one question** – Get both perspectives for any prompt
- 🎭 **Dynamic personas** – Each agent has a custom system prompt and tone
- 🎚️ **Mode control** – Choose to hear from one or both agents per input
- ⚡ **Powered by GPT-4 / GPT-4o** – Leverages the latest OpenAI models
- 🧩 **Modular design** – Easily extend with new personalities or routing logic

💬 How It Works
Just type your message and ChoiceCraft will reply with both perspectives by default:

You: I'm overwhelmed at work and don't know what to do.

🧘 Therapist:
It's completely okay to feel this way. Let's unpack what's been causing that stress and figure out what support you need.

🔥 Choaser:
Burn it all down (kidding... mostly). You need space, boundaries, and maybe a day where you ghost everyone. Recharge now or crash later.

🧭 Mode Commands
Want to control which agent responds? Use these simple inline commands:

Command Effect

- therapist Respond only as the Therapist
- choaser Respond only as the Choaser
- both Respond with both (default mode)

You can type your message normally, or add a command like:

    I'm frustrated with everything. #choaser
