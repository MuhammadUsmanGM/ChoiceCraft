# 🧠 ChoiceCraft – Dual-Persona Conversational AI

**ChoiceCraft** is an OpenAI-powered AI assistant that responds to your input with two distinct personas:

- 🧘‍♂️ **Therapist** – Calm, empathetic, and emotionally intelligent
- 🔥 **Choaser** – Bold, unfiltered, and radically honest

Whether you're seeking emotional support or a raw dose of truth, ChoiceCraft empowers you to explore both paths — and craft your own insight from the contrast.
